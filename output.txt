There were trade and commerce relations between India and Europe
since ancient times. There was great demand for Indian pepper, cumin,
demand for two
cinnamon, cardamom, ginger and many other spices in Europe. The trade
relations between India, Europe and other Asian countries continued even
during the Middle Ages. The Arab merchants carried Asian merchandise
to Constantinople of Eastern Roman (Byzantium) Empire. The Italian
merchants would buy these goods and then sell them in European
countries. Constantinople was thus the center of international trade
and was considered as the 'Gateway of European Trade'. While Arab
merchants had gained monopoly over the trade in Asian countries, Italian
traders had gained monopoly over trade in Europe. The merchandise from
Asia brought good profits to Italian merchants.
The fall of Constantinople: The trade and commerce between Asia
and Europe was carried on place through the city of Constantinople. In
1453, the Ottoman Turks captured the city of Constantinople. As a result,
all the trade routes connecting the city of Constantinople came under the
control of Turks. The Turks started levying too many taxes on the goods
passing through these routes. As a result, trade became unprofitable.
Meanwhile, Spain, Portugal and other European rulers were attempting
to break the monopoly of Italian traders. They started encouraging
enterprising sailors to find a new sea route to India. The invention of
compass, astrolabes, and gunpowder provided further impetus to this
venture.
